Test:

    wordmap.Occurrences occ = new wordmap.Occurrences( );
 
    occ. put( "hello", "file", new wordmap.Position(1,2));
    occ. put( "hello", "file", new wordmap.Position(3,4));
    occ. put( "goodbye", "f2", new wordmap.Position(5,6));
    occ. put( "goodbye", "file", new wordmap.Position(1,2));

    System. out. println( occ );
    System. out. println( "countWords      " + occ. countWords( ));
    System. out. println( "count           " + occ. count( ));
    System. out. println( "goodbye in f2   " + occ. count( "goodbye", "f2" ));
    System. out. println( "goodbye in f4   " + occ. count( "goodbye", "f4" ));
    System. out. println( "farewell        " + occ. count( "farewell" )); 

Expected Output:

word "goodbye" occurs 2 times:
   in file "f2":
      at line 5, column 6
   in file "file":
      at line 1, column 2
word "hello" occurs 2 times:
   in file "file":
      at line 1, column 2
      at line 3, column 4

countWords       2
count            4
goodbye in f2    1
goodbye in f4    0
farewell         0
